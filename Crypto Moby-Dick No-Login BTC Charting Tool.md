# **Crypto Moby-Dick: No-Login BTC Charting Tool**

A simple, no-login Bitcoin (BTC) real-time price and K-line chart viewing tool with support for various timeframes and common technical indicators.

## **Project Origin**

This small project was born during a boring, spoon-fed old-fashioned JavaScript university lecture. At the time, feeling tired of the teacher's lecturing, an idea suddenly popped into my head: could I use code to create a simple charting tool so I could "legitimately" check the market while in class?

Thus, with the powerful assistance of AI, this HTML file, completely generated by AI code, came into being. It doesn't use complex frameworks, just a simple HTML structure and a lot of native JavaScript. I hope it can provide some fun (and market information) for friends like me who are looking for a little distraction during monotonous moments.

## **Features**

* **Real-time Price Display:** Fetches and displays the latest price of BTC/USDT.  
* **Price Change Indication:** The price number shows green (up) or red (down) based on price changes.  
* **K-line Chart:** Displays K-line charts for different timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d).  
* **Chart Type Switching:** Supports Candle, Line, and Area chart types.  
* **Common Technical Indicators:** Integrates the display and switching of indicators like MA (Moving Average), BOLL (Bollinger Bands), EMA (Exponential Moving Average), SAR (Parabolic SAR), Volume, MFI (Money Flow Index), and OBV (On-Balance Volume).  
* **Crosshair and Info Box:** When hovering over the chart, a crosshair and a detailed info box for the current data point are displayed (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and active indicator values) (seems to have a bug, help needed).  
* **Unclosed Candle Countdown:** Displays a countdown of the remaining time for the current unclosed K-line candle near the last candle bar (help needed).  
* **No Login Required:** Just open the HTML file to use, no registration or login needed.

## **How to Use**

1. Download the new\_fileD.html file to your local computer.  
2. Open the HTML file directly using any modern browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) (Chrome is recommended as Edge might have bugs).  
3. After the page loads, it will automatically start fetching data and displaying the chart.

## **Areas Where Help is Needed**

As a project completely generated by AI and born from a "slacking off" idea, it still has many imperfections. Contributions from developers are highly welcome to make this small tool better\!

* **Data Source Stability and Expansion:** Currently uses only Binance's public API, which may have delays or instability. Consider integrating more data sources or using WebSocket for more real-time updates.  
* **Volume Footprint:** The Volume Footprint feature mentioned in the previous discussion was not implemented due to data source limitations. It would be a significant improvement if a suitable data source could be found and the drawing logic implemented.  
* **Code Optimization and Refactoring:** The code structure is relatively simple. It could benefit from modularization, optimizing Canvas drawing performance, improving event handling, etc.  
* **More Technical Indicators:** Integrate more common technical indicators like MACD, RSI, KD, etc.  
* **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the user interface and user experience, such as better mobile responsiveness, chart zooming and panning, customizable indicator parameters, etc.  
* **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Add more robust error handling and provide friendly prompts to the user when data loading fails or API calls encounter errors.  
* **Code Comments and Documentation:** Improve code comments and write more detailed development documentation.
